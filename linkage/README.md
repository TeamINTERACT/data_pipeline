# Linkages

Linkage files are critical files that contain all of the participant information to link the data across the different methods of data collection and waves of data. The code for these files is bespoke and not automated because there are often changes to the data collection process. As well, project coordinators responsible for the data collection create these files semi-manually during data collection.
